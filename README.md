Overview 

In today's fast-paced world, gathering correct and reliable data is crucial for making informed decisions. Traditional polling methods, such as phone and door-to-door surveys, are becoming increasingly obsolete as technology continues to evolve. Considering this, we are excited to introduce our revolutionary new polling web application that will change the way polling is conducted. 

Problem Statement: 

Bias polling data is leading to increased political and social divides in the United States  

 

“Lately, the Sea of Polls is deeper than ever before, and darker. From the late nineteen-nineties to 2012, twelve hundred polling organizations conducted nearly thirty-seven thousand polls by making more than three billion phone calls. Most Americans refused to speak to them. This skewed results.” - Jill Sabore, The New Yorker, 2015 

 

 

  

 

Polling is conducted in a way that yields inconsistent results. It’s time for polling to be done on a wider scale; in a transparent way. Creating a web application that can be accessed anywhere in the United States that can poll the user and visualize the results.  

The primary audience is the working-class American citizen. Ideally the application would work on a national scale. My project will solve a core problem with today’s voting climate. Everyone will benefit. Entirely nonprofit and nonpartisan. There will be no opinion pieces, advertisements, microtransactions. 

How will the application be developed and deployed? 

Project will be hosted on GitHub and continually updated in the cloud. Project will have multiple languages and concepts studied while at Auburn.
